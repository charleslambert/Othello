# Othello-Ruby
Ruby version of Othello board game

Requirements

ruby
gosu

The versions used for testing were:
ruby version 2.1.5
gosu version 0.8.6

Operation

When you run the game there will be two prompts for the player names. 
Type your name and then press the return key.
The rest of the game uses the mouse.
Click the space you want to put your piece in.
To close the game press "c" and to reset press "r" 

The game works as it should. In the future I would like to add multiple states for the window 
to make a better GUI.
